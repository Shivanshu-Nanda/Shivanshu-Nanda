## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm ## Shivanshu Nanda, a data scientist based in India. 
I love turning data into meaning full insights, that brings out the best that helps to analyze a messy data. 
outside of data, code, and dashboards, you will find me watching anime, hitting the gym, or clicking photos and editing them. 

## Fun Facts:
- I don't like tea but coffee works as fuel.
- Demon Slayer is my favorite anime.
